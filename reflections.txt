Your response goes here!

What new skills have you learned?
	* I haven't learned new skills in HTML and CSS just yet, as I do have quite a bit of experience with them. However, getting exposure to the Udacity Feedback extension has been a learning experience for me. I teach HTML and CSS, and learned about writing automated tests with Ruby/Capybara etc to help me grade student submissions. It's been a difficult process and I wasn't able to tailor the tests exactly how I wanted - being able to write tests for the Udacity Feedback extension is something I'm looking forward to learn.

What has been easy?
	* Finishing the HTML Problem set has been pretty easy for me so far.

What has been difficult?
	* The difficulty that I've experienced has less to do with the code and more to do with nmy overall motivation/time management. I've been enrolled in this nanodegree for a long time and felt bad about losing motivation almost a year ago. The difficult thing for me has been to just get started from the beginning again.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
	* I've used the strategies of researching when necessary, but it's mostly the self-motivating and growth mindset that have been helpful for me so far. I'm really trying to coontinue my progress and not give up.
